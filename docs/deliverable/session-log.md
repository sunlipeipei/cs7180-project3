# Annotated Claude Code Session Log

**Project:** BypassHire — Master Profile Management (FR-1.6)
**Date:** March 21, 2026
**Feature:** Master Profile Management module — the data backbone for resume tailoring, interactive editing, and auto-fill phases
**Claude Code Model:** Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context)

---

## Session 1: Project Setup (Part 1)

### 1.1 Initialize Repository and CLAUDE.md

**Commit:** `134cd6e` — *Add CLAUDE.md and customize .claude/ workflow for BypassHire*

Started by running `/init` in Claude Code to generate a baseline `CLAUDE.md`. Iterated on the generated file to include:
- Project overview and status
- 3-phase architecture (Resume Tailoring → Interactive Editing → Auto-Fill)
- Key technical decisions (Claude API, .docx format, Zod validation, Vitest)
- Enforced conventions (TDD mandatory, 80% minimum coverage)
- Development workflow order: `/plan → /tdd → /build-fix → /code-review → /test-coverage → /e2e → /verify`

> **[ANNOTATION — Tool: /init + Edit]**
> `/init` scaffolded the initial CLAUDE.md by scanning the repo. I then used Claude Code's Edit tool to refine it — adding the `@import` reference to `docs/PRD_Resume_Refine_AutoFill_Tool.md` and specifying architecture decisions from the PRD. This ensures Claude Code has full project context on every session start.

### 1.2 Configure .claude/ Workflow Framework

Installed 17 markdown files from [everything-claude-code](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code) into `.claude/`:
- **7 slash commands** (`commands/`): `/plan`, `/tdd`, `/build-fix`, `/code-review`, `/test-coverage`, `/e2e`, `/verify`
- **5 agent definitions** (`agents/`): planner (opus), tdd-guide (sonnet), build-error-resolver, code-reviewer, e2e-runner
- **5 skill documents** (`skills/`): tdd-workflow, verification-loop, backend-patterns, coding-standards, e2e-testing

Customized all generic examples (SmartGroceryAssistant, prediction markets) to BypassHire-specific examples: resume tailoring, context extraction, section matching.

> **[ANNOTATION — Context Management: .claude/ directory]**
> The `.claude/` directory auto-loads at session start. Skills provide passive knowledge (always in context), commands are invoked on demand via `/slash-commands`, and agents are spawned as subprocesses with their own tool access. This three-layer architecture means Claude Code has domain-specific TDD and code review knowledge without me re-explaining it each session.

### 1.3 PR Review and Iteration

**Commits:** `8fe68c0`, `4391732` — *Address PR #1 review feedback*

Opened PR #1 for the setup work. Claude Code helped address review feedback:
- Removed undefined "ECC" references from command footers
- Updated skill examples to use BypassHire domain (resumes instead of markets)
- Added `.gitignore` with Node.js, Playwright, and env exclusions
- Trimmed verbose simulated output from `tdd.md` and `e2e.md` (-66 lines)
- Removed `origin: ECC` from all skill frontmatter

> **[ANNOTATION — Tool: code-review agent]**
> The `/code-review` command caught leftover generic references that would confuse Claude Code in future sessions. Fixing these in the setup phase prevented context pollution later.

## Session 2: Explore → Plan → Implement → Commit

### 2.1 EXPLORE: Understanding the Requirements

Used Claude Code's exploration tools to understand what needed to be built:

```
# Glob — find existing project files
> Glob("docs/**/*.md")
  → docs/PRD_Resume_Refine_AutoFill_Tool.md
  → docs/tdd-workflow-guide.md

# Read — study the PRD requirements for FR-1.6
> Read("docs/PRD_Resume_Refine_AutoFill_Tool.md")
  → Found FR-1.6: Master Profile Management
  → Found FR-3.2: Auto-fill requires structured address, certifications
  → Found FR-3.4: Screening questions need preferences/career summary

# Read — understand the existing workflow framework
> Read("docs/tdd-workflow-guide.md")
  → Understood the 3-layer architecture: commands → agents → skills
  → Confirmed TDD cycle: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR

# Grep — check for any existing profile code
> Grep("profile", glob="src/**/*.ts")
  → No results (greenfield implementation)
```

> **[ANNOTATION — Phase: EXPLORE | Tools: Glob, Read, Grep]**
> Exploration confirmed this was a greenfield module. Reading the PRD revealed that FR-3.2 (Workday auto-fill) requires structured address fields with city/country required, and FR-3.4 needs preferences for screening question generation. These requirements shaped the data model design — without exploring first, I might have built a simpler flat structure that couldn't support Phase 3.

### 2.2 PLAN: Design the Implementation

Invoked `/plan` to spawn the planner agent (Opus model):

```
> /plan Implement Master Profile Management (FR-1.6)
```

The planner agent produced `docs/plan-master-profile.md` containing:

1. **Architecture** — File structure with 6 source files under `src/profile/`
2. **Data Model** — `MasterProfile` type with 15 top-level fields and 11 sub-types (Address, Links, Skill, WorkExperience, Education, Project, Certification, ContextSources, Preferences, SalaryRange)
3. **Merge Strategy** — Identity-based array deduplication:
   - `skills`: deduplicate by `name`
   - `workExperience`: deduplicate by `company|title|startDate`
   - `education`: deduplicate by `school|degree`
   - `projects`: deduplicate by `name`
   - `certifications`: deduplicate by `name|issuer`
4. **Error Types** — `ProfileValidationError`, `ProfileNotFoundError`, `ProfileIOError`
5. **TDD Plan** — 4 cycles mapped to RED→GREEN→REFACTOR:
   - Cycle 1: Types & Validation schemas
   - Cycle 2: Load profile from file
   - Cycle 3: Save profile to file
   - Cycle 4: Merge/update partial profile
6. **Commit Plan** — 12 planned commits (setup + 4 cycles × 3 phases)
7. **Acceptance Criteria** — 10 items including 90% coverage threshold

> **[ANNOTATION — Phase: PLAN | Tool: /plan → planner agent (opus)]**
> The planner agent used the Opus model for deeper reasoning about architecture trade-offs. Key decision: putting merge logic in its own file (`mergeProfile.ts`) because identity-based deduplication across 5 array types is complex enough to warrant isolation. The 4-cycle TDD plan mapped directly to the module's 4 capabilities (validate, load, save, merge), making each cycle independently testable. I reviewed the plan and confirmed before proceeding.

### 2.3 IMPLEMENT: TDD Cycles (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)

**Commit:** `8254659` — *feat: implement Master Profile Management module (FR-1.6)*

Invoked `/tdd` to spawn the tdd-guide agent:

```
> /tdd Implement the Master Profile Management plan from docs/plan-master-profile.md
```

#### TDD Cycle 1: Types & Validation (schema.ts)

**RED** — Wrote 19 failing tests in `schema.test.ts`:
```typescript
// Tests written FIRST — all fail because schema.ts doesn't exist yet
describe('MasterProfile schema validation', () => {
  it('accepts a complete valid profile');          // required + optional fields
  it('accepts a minimal profile');                  // only required fields
  it('accepts a profile with empty optional arrays');
  it('rejects profile missing required email');
  it('rejects profile missing required name');
  it('rejects invalid email format');
  it('validates nested WorkExperience fields');
  it('validates ISO 8601 date format');
  // ... 11 more tests
});
```

**GREEN** — Implemented `schema.ts` with Zod validation schemas:
```typescript
export const MasterProfileSchema = z.object({
  schemaVersion: z.number(),
  name: z.string().min(1),
  email: z.string().email(),
  phone: z.string(),
  skills: z.array(SkillSchema),
  // ... all 15 fields with proper validation
});
```

**REFACTOR** — Extracted sub-schemas into logical groups, inferred TypeScript types via `z.infer<>`.

> **[ANNOTATION — Phase: IMPLEMENT (TDD RED) | Tool: /tdd → tdd-guide agent]**
> The tdd-guide agent enforced writing tests before any implementation. When I ran `npm test` after writing schema.test.ts, all 19 tests failed with "Cannot find module" — confirming the RED phase. Only then did the agent proceed to write schema.ts.

#### TDD Cycle 2: Load Profile (profileManager.ts — load)

**RED** — 5 failing tests for `loadProfile()`:
- Valid file returns parsed profile
- Missing file throws `ProfileNotFoundError`
- Malformed JSON throws `ProfileIOError`
- Wrong schema throws `ProfileValidationError`
- Empty file throws error

**GREEN** — Implemented `loadProfile()` with `fs.readFile` + `JSON.parse` + Zod validation.

**REFACTOR** — Extracted custom error classes to `errors.ts`.

#### TDD Cycle 3: Save Profile (profileManager.ts — save)

**RED** — 5 failing tests for `saveProfile()`:
- Writes valid JSON (pretty-printed, 2-space indent)
- Creates parent directories if needed
- Validates before writing (fail-fast)
- Rejects invalid profile data
- Handles read-only directories

**GREEN** — Implemented `saveProfile()` with validation-first approach.

**REFACTOR** — Ensured round-trip consistency (load→save→load without data loss).

#### TDD Cycle 4: Merge Profile (mergeProfile.ts)

**RED** — 10 failing tests for `mergeProfile()`:
- Scalar fields: last-write-wins
- Skills deduplication by `name`
- WorkExperience deduplication by `company|title|startDate`
- `undefined` = skip, `null` = clear
- Preserve array order, append new items at end
- Don't mutate base object

**GREEN** — Implemented deep merge with identity-based deduplication:
```typescript
const ARRAY_IDENTITY_KEYS: Record<string, string[]> = {
  skills: ['name'],
  workExperience: ['company', 'title', 'startDate'],
  education: ['school', 'degree'],
  projects: ['name'],
  certifications: ['name', 'issuer'],
};
```

**REFACTOR** — Added barrel exports in `index.ts`, cleaned up public API.

```
Test Results: 39 tests passed, 0 failed
Coverage: 94.59% statements (threshold: 90%)
```

> **[ANNOTATION — Phase: IMPLEMENT (TDD GREEN→REFACTOR) | Tools: Write, Edit, Bash]**
> The tdd-guide agent ran `npm test` after each phase transition to verify state. After GREEN, it ran `npm test -- --coverage` to check the 90% threshold. The agent caught that `index.ts` barrel exports weren't covered and added them to the refactor phase. Total: 39 tests across 3 test files.

### 2.4 Code Review and Iteration

**Commit:** `20aa621` — *fix: address PR #3 review feedback*

After opening PR #3, the code review identified improvements:

1. **Post-merge Zod validation** — `mergeProfile()` now validates the merged result before returning, catching cases where a valid base + valid partial could produce an invalid result
2. **Deep-merge nested objects** — `address`, `links`, and `preferences` now deep-merge instead of being replaced wholesale
3. **ISO 8601 date validation** — Added regex validation (`/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/`) to all date fields (startDate, endDate, date, expirationDate)
4. **Error handling** — Wrapped `mkdir` in try/catch to produce `ProfileIOError` on write failures

Added 10 new tests covering these improvements (49 total, all passing).

> **[ANNOTATION — Phase: COMMIT + REVIEW | Tools: /code-review, Edit]**
> The code review agent caught that `mergeProfile` could silently produce invalid profiles if a merge resulted in, say, an empty required `name` field. Adding post-merge Zod validation was a critical safety net. This is the value of the prescribed workflow — `/code-review` after `/tdd` catches semantic issues that tests alone might miss.

### 2.5 COMMIT: Clean History

All commits follow a consistent pattern:
- **Conventional commit messages** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`)
- **Detailed bodies** explaining what changed and why
- **Co-authorship tag**: `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- **PR references** linking commits to GitHub issues (#2)

> **[ANNOTATION — Phase: COMMIT | Context Management: /clear, /compact]**
> Used `/clear` between sessions to reset context when switching from setup work (Part 1) to implementation work (Part 2). Used `/compact` mid-session when the TDD cycles generated long test output that wasn't needed for subsequent work. Used `--continue` to resume the session after reviewing PR feedback. These strategies kept the context window focused on the current task.

## Context Management Strategy Summary

| Strategy | When Used | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| **CLAUDE.md** | Every session start | Persistent project context — Claude Code reads this automatically |
| **`@import` PRD** | Planning phase | Full requirements available without copy-pasting into chat |
| **`.claude/` framework** | Every session | Skills auto-load domain knowledge; commands invoke specialized agents |
| **/clear** | Between phases | Reset context when switching from setup to implementation |
| **/compact** | Mid-session | Compress verbose test output to free context for new work |
| **--continue** | After PR review | Resume session with full prior context |
| **Plan document** | Implementation | `docs/plan-master-profile.md` serves as durable reference across sessions |

---

## Final State

- **49 tests passing** across 3 test files
- **94.59% statement coverage** (exceeds 90% threshold)
- **Clean public API** exported from `src/profile/index.ts`
- **7 commits** showing clear Explore → Plan → Implement → Commit progression

# Project 3: Production Application with Claude Code Mastery

**Due:** Tuesday by 11:59pm | **Points:** 200 | **Weight:** 19% of final grade

**Submitting:** a text entry box, a website url, or a file upload

## Objective

Build a production-grade, deployed application as a pair, demonstrating mastery of Claude Code's extensibility features, professional AI-assisted workflows, and production engineering practices taught in W10-W14.

## Approval Requirement

**Project idea must be approved by the professor on the #projects Slack channel at least one week before the deadline.**

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Production-ready application solving a real problem
- 2+ user roles or distinct feature areas
- Real-world use case (new idea)
- Portfolio/interview-worthy quality
- Deployed and accessible via public URL

### Technical Requirements

#### Architecture

- Next.js full-stack application (App Router or Pages Router)
- Database (PostgreSQL recommended, or equivalent)
- Authentication (Auth.js/NextAuth, Clerk, or equivalent)
- Deployed on Vercel (or equivalent platform with preview deploys)

#### Claude Code Mastery (core of this project)

Each of the following Claude Code concepts must be demonstrated with evidence in your repository:

**CLAUDE.md & Memory (W10):**
- Comprehensive CLAUDE.md with @imports for modular organization
- Auto-memory usage for persistent project context
- Evidence of CLAUDE.md evolution across the project (visible in git history)
- Project conventions, architecture decisions, and testing strategy documented

**Custom Skills (W12) — minimum 2:**
- At least 2 skills in `.claude/skills/` (e.g., /fix-issue, /add-feature, /deploy, /create-pr)
- Evidence of team usage (session logs or screenshots)
- At least one skill iterated from v1 to v2 based on real usage

**Hooks (W12) — minimum 2:**
- At least 2 hooks configured in `.claude/settings.json`
- At least one PreToolUse or PostToolUse hook (e.g., auto-format, block protected files, lint-on-edit)
- At least one quality-enforcement hook (e.g., Stop hook that runs tests)

**MCP Servers (W12) — minimum 1:**
- At least 1 MCP server integrated (database, Playwright, GitHub, or other)
- Configuration shared via `.mcp.json` in repository
- Evidence of use in development workflow (session logs or screenshots)

**Agents (W12-W13) — minimum 1 (choose any):**
- Custom sub-agents in `.claude/agents/` (e.g., security-reviewer, test-writer), OR
- Agent teams with `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`, OR
- Agent SDK feature built into the application (applying W13 patterns)
- Evidence of use (session log, PR, or screenshots showing agent output)

**Parallel Development (W12):**
- Evidence of worktree usage for parallel feature development
- At least 2 features developed in parallel (visible in git branch history)

**Writer/Reviewer Pattern + C.L.E.A.R. (W12):**
- At least 2 PRs using the writer/reviewer pattern (one agent writes, another reviews)
- C.L.E.A.R. framework applied in PR reviews (visible in PR comments)
- AI disclosure metadata in PRs (% AI-generated, tool used, human review applied)

#### Test-Driven Development (W11)

- TDD workflow (red-green-refactor) for at least 3 features
- Git history showing failing tests committed before implementation
- Unit + integration tests (Vitest or Jest)
- At least 1 E2E test (Playwright)
- 70%+ test coverage

#### CI/CD Pipeline (W14) — GitHub Actions

- Lint (ESLint + Prettier)
- Type checking (`tsc --noEmit`)
- Unit and integration tests
- E2E tests (Playwright)
- Security scan (`npm audit`)
- AI PR review (`claude-code-action` or `claude -p`)
- Preview deploy (Vercel)
- Production deploy on merge to main

#### Security (W14) — minimum 4 gates from the 8-gate pipeline

- Pre-commit secrets detection (Gitleaks or equivalent)
- Dependency scanning (`npm audit` in CI)
- At least one SAST tool or security-focused sub-agent
- Security acceptance criteria in Definition of Done
- OWASP top 10 awareness documented in CLAUDE.md

### Team Process

- 2 sprints documented (sprint planning + retrospective each)
- GitHub Issues with acceptance criteria as testable specifications
- Branch-per-issue workflow with PR reviews
- Async standups (minimum 3 per sprint per partner)
- C.L.E.A.R. framework applied in PR reviews
- Peer evaluations

## Deliverables

1. GitHub repository with full `.claude/` configuration (skills, hooks, agents, MCP)
2. Deployed application (Vercel production URL)
3. CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, all stages passing)
4. Technical blog post (published on Medium, dev.to, or similar)
5. Video demonstration (5-10 min, showcasing app + Claude Code workflow)
6. Individual reflections (one per partner, 500 words)
7. Showcase submission via Google Form (project name, URLs, thumbnail, video, blog)

## Rubric (200 points)

| Category | Points | Description |
